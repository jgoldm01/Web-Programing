<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>I was hired to examine security flaws of assignment 2 and 3. One is a client side
tool designed to display locations of students and login information using the 
google maps api. The other, where I found the most security flaws, is a node 
application to be hosted on heroku, which stores student's login information in
a mongodb database, also hosted on heroku. This back end program can return json
files of all or a few students, depending on input, as well as the current 
red-line train locations. The following is the results of my findings:
</p>

<h2> Methodology </h2>
<p> First I examined the characteristics of the assignment, to seee if there 
were any flaws inherent in the design. Aside from the fact that there was no
mention of security, nothing seemed incredibly off. I then checked the source
code, and saw how the input paramaters for the post request were formatted. 
I fooled around for a bit with exploiting that. 
</p>
<p> I then examined the sendLocation header. I figured that a mongo injection 
must be possible. Howevwer, inputs seemed decently sanitized, and after an hour
of attempting command injection I found myself with no results. 
</p>
<p>
	Having done the assignment before, I recalled that I had only signed up for 
	limited database memory on heroku, since it was the free option. Knowing this, 
	I wrote a bash script to repeatedly call curl on the sendLocation page, inputting
	data until the database was filled entirely. 
</p>
<p>
	While looking at the code I noticed that inputs into the database were being 
	read as part of the html file, so I fooled around with exploiting that 
	vulnerability. 
</p>

<h2> Abstract of Findings </h2>
<p> 
	Location Spoofing: This application has the implicit contract that users will
	send their location with their username. However, it is very possibile for 
	users send fradulent information. This may impact the authenticity of the
	application
</p>
<p>
	Cross Site Scripting: When user input becomes incorporated into html code, 
	attackers can compromize the source code of the website, with as much ability
	to change the content as developers. 
</p>
<p>
	Cross Origin Resource Sharing: This site allows input and access from all
	other domains. A malicious site could redirect the user to your site, under the
	guise of being your site itself, and snatch private information that the user
	only intended for use by your website. 
</p>
<p>
	Denial of Service: A commonplace attack, when attackers send an exorbitant
	number of requests with the intention of overloading the server with too much
	data. This results in a shut down of the website, and is hence known as a denial 
	of service attack. 
</p>

<h2> Issues Found</h2>
<p> 
	note: how I found the issues is further discussed in the methodology section 
</p>

<h4> Location Spoofing </h4>
<p> The server does not verify the true location of individuals posting 
to /sendLocation. The website currently relies on data send in the form 
"lat__&lng__&login__", which can be easily editted or forged. In the image I 
provide, parisMan has a longitude that is clearly out of the range of reasonable
longitudes. This is in the server.js file
</p>
This is a low severity security flaw as it allows individuals to forge their data,
but does not jeapordize the website structure or data in any other way. 
<img src="location_spoofing.png" alt="location spoofing">
<ul>
	<li> One way to improve this feature would be to but bounds checks; ensure that
	latitude and longitude were within -90 & 90, and -180 and 180, respectively. 
	</li>
	<li> Changing the post data would also improve security. The site could require
	a getLocation object itself, rather than trusting that the input would be 
	trustworthy. 
	</li>
</ul>

<h4> Cross Site Scripting (XSS) </h4>
<p> the login string from the mongodb database is input directly into html code. 
	Because this is a string input by the user, attackers can input their own code
	into that of the website while their inputs are in the database. 
</p>
This is a high severity security flaw because it permits actual altering of the
source code itself. This could potentially effect the entire website as a while
and is a vulnerability which gives the attacker a lot of power. I was able to put
a youtube video into the website using this method. 
<img src="cross_site_scripting.png" alt="XSS">
<ul>
	<li> 
		One way this threat can be mitigated is by sanitizing inputs. For instance, 
		a "<" character is found in the login information, then it should be 
		discarded. 
		</br> 
		if (string.indexOf('<') == -1) {
			//code to put information in database here
		}
	</li>
</ul>

<h4> Open Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CSRF vulnerability)</h4>
<p> 
	This issue was found in the server.js file. As explained above, any site
	is permitted to send and recieve requests from this site. this can lend itself 
	to CSRF attacks, in which a user sends data through a malicious website to yours. 
	This can cause leakage of sensitive information
</p>
	This is a medium level security threat. the leakage of information is harmful, 
	but this site is designed to be available to most users anyway. The user must
	also be vigilant of social engineering attacks such as this. In addition, 
	the information that is passed is location and login, which is not the most
	sensitive. 
<ul>
	<li>
		A solution to this would be to enumerate sites and users that are permitted
		to send and recieve data, by changing "*" the line:
		</br>
		res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
	</li>
</ul>

<h4> Denial of Service </h4>
<p>
	This issue is found in the server.js file. 
</p>
This is a medium level security threat. It does not leak user's sensitive information, 
just results in the temporary downing of the server. It can arise when attackers
repeatedly send input or call requests from the server and overload it. In this
instance, it is possible to overload the mongodb because the server has limited 
space. 
<img src="DOS.png" alt="denial of service">
<ul>
	<li>
		This can be prevented by limiting the number of requests from a single 
		user, or from a single ip address. If too many are noticed within too short
		an amount of time, then the inputs should not be added to the table. 
		even more effective, the handshake connection should be refused. In addition, 
		if this server is to run for a long time, then the db table should be cleaned
		from time to time to prevent overflow. 
	</li>
</ul>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>
	In total, it appears security was not considered in the construction of this
	application. If the intention is for the site to continue in existence for 
	a while, I would recommend that the mongodb either have some routine cleanup
	function or be extended in size. In addition, inputs should be sanitized 
	wherever they are input into the source code. Users should be monitored as
	well, with limits to those which can request data, and limits to how much 
	data can be input in a given amount of time.
