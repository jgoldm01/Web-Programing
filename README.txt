1) This repository demonstrates the work I have done in comp20, web programming. 
It's purpose, i suppose, is to be an easy way for professor and student to update
code, but also to give an experience with revision control, as well as building 
a github profile / presence online. 

2) My favorite assignment was either 2 or 3. I really liked marauder's map because
it gave me experience with using APIs, something I previously though I wouldn't
enjoy, but which proved to be very rewarding. Google's apis are also very well 
documented. 
Assignment 3 was good because I learned some crucial server-side code from it. 
Heroku and nodejs may not be used in 10 years, but I feel the concepts I learned 
from that assignment will continue to be useful. 


3) I think I've grown a lot from day one to now. I took 5 compsci classes this
semester, so I really have grown a lot as a programmer. I'm very glad I took 
this class though. I'm glad to have coded the projects I did. A criticism of this
class that I had heard before is that one could learn these concepts on one's own. 
In the end that's sort of what ming got us to do, though he provided some 
very useful lectures and documentation. I suppose much of computer science you kind
of have to learn by yourself. Regardless, though, I am a much much better web
programmer (and I believe programmer in general) becuase of this class

4) I want to say API's, I think. (server side things may prove to be more useful)
examples: reading documentation and guessing functionality. I've gotten a lot
better at understanding an API from its documentation; I threw together the
google charts diagram on our final project rather efficiently as a result of this. 
Because of the extensive use of APIs, I've gotten a feel for the programming 
conventions that designers put in their code, and if I cannot find an online
resource enumerating the command to type for a desired computation, I find that
I can often guess what the command is. 

5) Server side. I feel that any large and widely used web-hosted service will
need a server, either to preserve user accounts, system-wide memory, or some
other variables that should remain consistent across the web. I've heard some
negative reviews of apache from ming, but I think, like, it might be good to 
know. or maybe I could delve further into nodejs. Or some other technology I 
completely have no idea about. 

Seriously, ming, it's been good! Thanks for this course, I've really appreciated
it.
