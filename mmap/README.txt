I believe all aspects of the assignment have been correctly implemented. 
The navigator.geolocation method was having difficulties that I believe I fixed.
however, for the sake of error handling, if the geolocation does not recognize 
the location of the user, then the user's icon is displayed in the center of 
Boston. 
My icon's info window can be accessed by clicking on the icon, as well as the
characters' and students'. 

I made a piazza post about the navigator method, and the comments were very 
helpful. 

I spent approximately 6 hours on the project.
